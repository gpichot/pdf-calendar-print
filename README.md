# 🗓️ A Yearly Calendar to Print

I was looking for a single page calendar that I could print to hang on my wall
and have an overview of the year. I couldn't find one that could fit on a single
page, not too fancy (I don't want to use too much ink). So I made one using
React.

🎨 Yay, I like to colors days depending on wether I will give a workshop, teach
a class or just be on holidays. 🤷‍♂️

Go to [Print Yearly
Calendar](https://gpichot.github.io/print-yearly-calendar/).

Customize the locale, the beginning month, the country used for public holidays
and choose `Save as PDF` or `Print` in the `Print` panel of your browser.
